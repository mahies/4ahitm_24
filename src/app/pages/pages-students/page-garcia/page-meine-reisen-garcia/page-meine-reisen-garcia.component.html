  <h2>Born in the Philippines</h2>
  <p>I was born in the Philippines. I grew up with my Grandparents while my mom and dad work overseas. At the age of 8 my mom flew to Taipeh,Taiwan. I was devastated. I cried every night. And my dad.. I never really have had a close relationship with him. Until now i am not close. </p>
